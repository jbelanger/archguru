# ArchGuru Product Roadmap
*Strategic development plan for Universal AI Architecture Decision Platform with LLM-Driven Research*

## Vision Statement
Build a **Universal AI Architecture Decision Platform** that uses competing AI model teams with autonomous research to provide architectural guidance across technology domains. Make architectural consulting more accessible through real-time, multi-perspective decision support.

## Product Strategy
- **LLM-Driven Research**: Each model autonomously researches and synthesizes information
- **Multi-Model Competition**: Core differentiation through AI model team competition
- **Universal Decision Engine**: Single platform for all architectural decision types
- **Performance Analytics**: Data-driven insights on model expertise and research strategies

## Core Architecture (Simplified)
```
User Input → Model Teams (A, B, C) → Autonomous Research → Recommendations → Cross-Model Debate → Final Output
                     ↓
            Each LLM uses GitHub/Reddit/SO APIs as tools
```

- **Choose research strategies** that align with their reasoning approach
- **Adapt research depth** based on decision complexity
- **Develop expertise** in specific research methodologies
- **Critique and improve** each other's research approaches

This creates a self-improving system where models compete not just on reasoning, but on research strategy and information synthesis.
